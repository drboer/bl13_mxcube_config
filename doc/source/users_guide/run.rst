Running MXCuBE
+++++++++++++++

In order to make easy the launch of the application, we have defined the launchers and resource
files in such a way, we could define an alias to startup the application.

The current release of the application at the `XALOC` beamline (pcbl1305) can be started by typing::

    mxcube

This command is defined as an alias in the `bash.rc` file for `opbl13` user. Different aliases are
foreseen in order to provide different version of the application for testing purposes.
